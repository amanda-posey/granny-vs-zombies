1. What HTML, CSS, and or JavaScript skills you learned while building your game?

I learned a lot more about the Phaser toolkit, even though I didn't end up using it in the end. I also learned more about canvas-specific commands, gravity (as a game element), and invisible arrays.

2. What's one topic you want to spend more practice on?

I need to learn more about for loops. Always.
