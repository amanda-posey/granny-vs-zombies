# Zombie Superstore

I will use Phaser and JS to create a game in which the user is a hapless human who was shopping their local big box store when zombies attacked. The user will have to run through the aisles to evade the zombie, while possibly finding things along the way to (1) earn points and (2) slow down the zombie. 

User will be awarded points for basic time on the board, finding bonuses, and slowing down the aggressor. My plan is somewhere between Pac-Man and Temple Run.
